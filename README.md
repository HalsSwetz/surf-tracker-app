# ***Waves Tracker App*** (or just *WAVES* for short)

### *Description*
#### The Waves Tracker App, or just *WAVES* for short, is an application that allows users to create an account, make a profile for themsleves with a picture and bio, add waves they've surfed with details about the location, and have a look at other users' profiles to learn about their travels. Users can add, update, and delete waves from their own profile, as well as view those saved details for their different waves in an appealing and modern styling.  Users can also create their own profile, and see a list of all the other users, and click on their link to view their profile.

> I built the *WAVES* app because as a lifelong surfer I know a lot of the passion for surfing is found in traveling to, or finding new waves to surf.  I wanted to practice creating a User based app that could embed wave data in each user's profile, allowing them to store the waves they have visited and access those details any time they sign in to the app.  I also thought that this app would provide a sharing or community aspect in which users could view other surfer's profiles and check out their bio, and the waves they've surfed. Since surfers travel the globe in search of new, challenging, and secret surf spots, there will never be a shortage of waves for users to add to their profile!

## *Getting Started*

#### To see the project planning for this application on my Trello page, click [here](https://trello.com/b/c6HXYJLd/surf-tracker-planning) !

To get started, just navigate to the [*WAVES*](https://surf-waves-app-5c54182282da.herokuapp.com/) page on your browser and either Sign Up, or if you are returning, Sign In!

The navigation of the ***Waves Tracker App*** page is pretty straightforward, and at all times there will be a navigation bar at the top of the page showing you some different options for you to utilize to find more features.  You will be brought to the "*My Waves*" page when you login, with clearly accesible functionality to "*Add a Wave*" to your profile. If you already have waves saved on your profile, you can easily click on the link to display the details of that wave, and once there you can easily utilize the "*Edit Wave*" or "*Delete Wave*" functionalities. At the top of the page the navigation bar links will also allow you to view your own profile, and then you can edit your profile picture or bio while you are there. Also at the top of the page there's an option to "*Explore Profiles*" which will allow you to check out the other users' profiles. 

## Features
- User registration and authentication
- Create and edit user profiles
- Add and manage waves

### Technology Used
- Node.js: backend
- Express: Web application framework
- MongoDB: Database for storing user and wave data
- EJS: Templating engine for dynamic rendering
- CSS: Styling the frontend

### Next Steps for the ***WAVES Tracker App***

My stretch goals for this app were to make the functions of the page a little more extensive: 
- Allow users to favorite waves both on their own profile and on other users' profiles
- Search for a wave on the app by name
- Add photos of a particular location to the waves data that is stored 
- Access other user's waves when viewing their profile

The next step in improving this application would be to create the route that allows users to explore other user's waves when they have navigated to someone else's profile.
